## How to Build

We developed this solution using GHC 7.10.3. In theory, GHC 7.8.4 should also work.

First, some platform independent preparation steps are necessary to install the required dependencies.
All commands (unless stated otherwise) assume that the current directory is the one containing
the `mf.cabal` file.

(1) Setup sandbox (optional, but recommended) and install dependencies

        $ cabal sandbox init
        $ cabal update
        $ cabal install --only-dependencies

(2) If not yet installed, install `uuagc` either globally or in the sandbox

        $ cabal install uuagc

The third step requires the `make` tool, but alternatively, 
the commands found inside the `Makefile` can also be run manually.

(3) Build project

  (a) If `uuagc` is compiled globally

          $ make

  (b) otherwise

          $ cabal exec make

      This will setup the `PATH` accordingly before executing `make`.

## Our Examples

The folder `examples` contains the example programs in the While language that can be
analysed using the executable in this project. The resulting DOT graphs are also created
in that directory.
