Running the code
================

Besides ghc, you will need happy, alex and uuagc to build all the files. 
You should be able to compile the code with `make all`. 
To clean up, rebuild and start ghci in the Dev module all at once, run `make
clean dev`.

Once you're in ghci in the Dev module, you can run different analyses (that
you first need to develop). 

The file AttributeGrammar.ag contains the datatype declarations for storing
programs and expressions in the language.
